# PJCAdmin
The Admin site, App backend, and database links

The Pocket Job Coach project is a system to facilitate PARC's assistance to disabled individuals 
regarding their ability to complete jobs at work and home and to stay on task. "Administrators" and "Job Coaches" 
are employees of PARC, while "Users" and "Parents" are PARC's clients. "User" refers to the disabled individual 
being assigned routines. Admins can manage accounts and Parent/Job Coach assignment. Parents and Job Coaches can 
create routines and assign routines to their respective children and assignees. This is all accomplished through
the PJCAdmin system.

Users only have access via the PJCApp and the PJCMobile systems. Through these systems, the User can see and work
through the routines they have been assigned, view their Parent and Job Coach's contact information for further 
assistance, take notes, change their password, and access other tools to assist their productivity on the job.
